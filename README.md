# Sonoff_alternative_fw
Alternative Sonoff for you project. Control over http on the local network using dns.

With a query from the client, you can transfer data to and from
a commercial Sonoff Basic product.
For example, you can switch relays or use other variables for any work in Sonoff. 
Warning: After playing with this firmware, you will no longer be able to use Sonoff as before. 
If you want to go back, you need to make a backup of the original FW.
